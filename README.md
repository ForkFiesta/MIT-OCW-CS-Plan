# MIT Course 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering) Study Repository

Welcome to my personal repository! ðŸŽ“ The purpose of this repo is to organize my study efforts, problems, and solutions while I complete the MIT Course 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering) curriculum via their OpenCourseWare (OCW) lectures.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- Notes and summaries on each course
- Problem sets and my solutions
- Links to corresponding OCW lecture playlists
